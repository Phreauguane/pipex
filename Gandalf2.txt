At  that  moment  Gandalf  lifted  his  staff,  and  crying  aloud $
well,  Gandalf !M-bM-^@M-^Y  he  cried.  M-bM-^@M-^XDid  I  not  say  to  you:  if  you  pass  the $

Frodo.  M-bM-^@M-^XGandalf  was  our  guide,  and  he  led  us  through  Moria; $
Gandalf  fell  from  wisdom  into  folly,  going  needlessly  into  the $
Gandalf  in  life.  Those  that  followed  him  knew  not  his  mind $

Suddenly  Frodo  realized  that  it  reminded  him  of  Gandalf. $
FrodoM-bM-^@M-^Ys  mind:  was  this  a  vision  of  Gandalf  on  one  of  his $

Lothlorien  I  do  not  know  what  Gandalf  intended  to  do. $
His  own  plan,  while  Gandalf  remained  with  them,  had $
mastery.  But  in  Moria  the  burden  of  Gandalf  had  been  laid $
M-bM-^@M-^XWould  that  Gandalf  were  here!  How  my  heart  yearns  for $
